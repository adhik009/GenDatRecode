\title{
function to recode SNP marker calls of progenies that match to one of the parent SNP marker calls in linkage mapping studies
}
\description{
The function recodes SNP markers of progenies by referencing the parent calls. For example, if the SNP call of the progeny matches the marker call of parent 1, it finds out the match and recodes the marker call to a user specified text object. For example, for marker1 the marker call in C and for parent1 it is C, the marker call of progenies is changed to 1 or A. The choice of 1, A or anything else can be made by the user, as this can be specified by the user. The use of this function should follow the use of function missing_recode from the same package. Whatever the missing data has been coded as needs to be specified in this function as well.
}
\usage{
P1_recode(gendat.mat, P1.call)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{gendat.mat}{
This is a genotypic data matrix with SNP markers in rows and individuals in columns. The first column should contain the marker names while the first row should contain individual IDs. The second column should contain the genotypic information of one of the parent while the third column should contain the genotypic call for each marker of another parent. Ideally in plant breeding linkage mapping studies, population is generated by crossing two distinct individuals and the progenies are used for mapping.
}
  \item{P1.call}{
Whatever the P1 call needs to be specfied to. For example, A or a or 1 etc.
}
}

}
\value{
It returns the same genotypic matrix provided, with the genotypic calls of progenies matching that of parent 1.

If the genotypic data is in the format of A,T,G,C forbid the use of parent1 call as A. It should be specified to a or 1. \section{Warning }{....} ~
